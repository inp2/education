# Course Description

Data visualization is crucial to conveying information drawn from models,
observations or investigations. This course will provide an overview of
historical and modern techniques for visualizing data, drawing on
quantitative, statistical, and network-focused datasets. Topics will include
construction of communicative visualizations, the modern software ecosystem
of visualization, and techniques for aggregation and interpretation of data
through visualization.Particular attention will be paid to the Python
ecosystem and multi-dimensional quantitative datasets. 

## Course Overview

This course is designed to give practical advice to students on
communicating data through visualization.  This will involve a considerable
amount of programming, and typically this programming will be done in Python.
For the most part, our data will be quantitative and multi-dimensional.  The
course will aim to provide both an understanding of what data visualizations
communicate and a set of tools for constructing them yourself.

The course will follow a common pattern within each three-hour instructional
session.  The first 60-90 minutes will be focused on lecture, where concepts
and tools will be introduced; typically, each class will focus on one type of
visualization or class of visualization.  The remaining time will include
exploration of a dataset, which may be independent or in groups, and then a
wrap-up session at the end.

Students are expected to have laptops with them, as well as access to Python
installations, and will be encouraged to participate in class.  Homework will
be assigned and collected utilizing GitHub Classroom in the form of Jupyter
notebooks.

## Pre- and Co-requisites

None, although Python programming experience is assumed.

# Course Overview

The central themes of the course are:

1. What are the components of an effective visualization of quantitative data?
2. What tools and ecosystems are available for visualizing data?
3. What systems can be put in place to generate visualizations rapidly and with
   high-fidelity representation?

# Course Materials

There is no textbook for this course.  All course materials will be posted to
the GitHub repository at https://github.com/inp2/Data-Viz-Fall2018.

As the course progresses, a list of recommended readings will be generated for
each class.  These will be included in the course materials repository, and
students are encouraged to fork that repository and issue pull requests to add
suggested readings.

# Academic Integrity

Please review and reflect on the academic integrity policy of the University of Illinois,
<http://admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/article1_part4_1-401.html> to which we subscribe.
By turning in materials for review, you certify that all work presented is your own and
has been done by you independently, or as a member of a designated group for group assignments.
If, in the course of your writing, you use the words or ideas of another writer, proper
acknowledgment must be given (using APA, Chicago, or MLA style). Not to do so is to commit
plagiarism, a form of academic dishonesty. If you are not absolutely clear on what constitutes
plagiarism and how to cite sources appropriately, now is the time to learn. Please ask me!
Please be aware that the consequences for plagiarism or other forms of academic dishonesty
will be severe. Students who violate university standards of academic integrity are
subject to disciplinary action, including a reduced grade, failure in the course, and
suspension or dismissal from the University.

# Statement of Inclusion

[Inclusive Illinois Committee Diversity Statement](http://www.inclusiveillinois.illinois.edu/supporting_docs/Inclusive%20Illinois%20Diversity%20Statement.pdf)

As the state's premier public university, the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign's core mission is to serve the interests of the
diverse people of the state of Illinois and beyond. The institution
thus values inclusion and a pluralistic learning and research
environment, one which we respect the varied perspectives and lived
experiences of a diverse community and global workforce. We support
diversity of worldviews, histories, and cultural knowledge across a
range of social groups including race, ethnicity, gender identity,
sexual orientation, abilities, economic class, religion, and their
intersections.

# Accessibility Statement
To obtain accessibility-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary
aids, students with disabilities must contact the course instructor
and the [Disability Resources and Educational Services](http://disability.illinois.edu/) (DRES) as soon
as possible.  To contact DRES you may visit 1207 S. Oak St.,
Champaign, call (217) 333-4603 (V/TTY), or e-mail a message to
disability@illinois.edu.

# Assignments and Evaluation

Students will be graded based on a combination of assignments (60%) and a final
project (40%).  The final project will be a capstone to the course, and will
have greater flexibility in software packages and data sources.  This project
will be introduced in Week 8.

Assignments in this course will be a mixture of coding/visualization work
and written work.
These two may not be distinct assignments; students will be
asked to describe their code and justify choices for making decisions with
respect to visualizations.

Students are expected, unless otherwise instructed, to be the principal authors
of their code.  This does not mean they may not investigate resources such as
StackOverflow, package documentation, etc; however, they *must* cite when
resources (especially StackOverflow and other "recipe" sites) are utilized.

Assignments will take two forms, and will be given at the end of each class.
Students will have until the following class to turn these in; assignments will
be collected electronically.

 * The first type of assignment will be a written document, constituting 
   either a brief literature review or an analysis of a visualization or
   set of visualizations.  The parameters for these assignments will be given
   during class, but will typically involve a critique of a visualization,
   including citing relevant works in the visualization literature.
 * The second type of assignment will be a hands-on, code-based assignment.
   Students will be provided either a dataset *or* a class of datasets from
   which they can choose, and construct one or multiple mechanisms of drawing
   information out of this visually.  These will be submitted in the form of
   Jupyter notebooks.  Each visualization must be accompanied by narrative
   description from the student describing why design decisions were made.

The submission process for homeworks will be described by example during class
before any homeworks are to be submitted.

Each assignment will be 75% "correctness" and 25% the narrative description of
the process.  "Correctness" in this case indicates that the code runs without
issue, results are produced, and each component of the assignment is completed.
The narrative description of the process will be graded on grammar and
completeness.

### Grading Policy

All assignments are required for all students. Completing all assignments is
not a guarantee of a passing grade.  All work must be completed in order to
pass this class. Late or incomplete assignments will not be given full credit
unless the student has contacted the instructor prior to the due date of the
assignment (or in the case of emergencies, as soon as practicable).

**Grading Scale:**

| 94-100 = A
| 90-93 = A-
| 87-89 = B+
| 83-86 = B
| 80-82 = B-
| 77-79 = C+
| 73-76 = C
| 70-72 = C-
| 67-69 = D+
| 63-66 = D
| 60-62 = D-
| 59 and below = F

### Incompletes

Students must request an incomplete grade from the instructor. The instructor
and student will agree on a due date for completion of coursework and the
student must file an Incomplete Form signed by the student, the instructor, and
the student’s academic advisor with the School’s records representative. More
information on incompletes is available here:
<http://webdocs.ischool.illinois.edu/registration/incomplete_grade_form.pdf>

### Late Assignments

Late Assignments are not excepted without permission from the instructor.
