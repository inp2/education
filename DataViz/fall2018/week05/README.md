# Week 5 - Types of Visualizations and Choosing Colors

This week we covered some catchup around data analysis and visualization.  Our
examples were just getting us started with plotting volume and image data.

## Homework 4: Project Proposal/Group Formation

The proposal should include the names of the members of your group and a short (1 to 2 page(s)) description of the visualization problem you plan to address. You should work in teams of at least two people for this assignment. You may not work in groups larger than 4 people. If you are looking for project partners, please post on slack in the teams section.

More information can be found in the Final Exam folder.

The repository is public by default so people can see your work. If you have any restriction such as data privacy, you can make it private. You can also make it private first and make it public once you finish. Please contact us as soon as possible if you can't access the GitHub org.
