# Week 8 - Knowing Bokeh

This week we had an introduction to Bokeh.

## Homework 5: Playing with Bokeh

I want you to use the data you have to investigate an country's government for corruption, U.N. violations, or maybe they are just a good government. While there may be no right or wrong answer to this question, there certainly are wrong ways of answering the question. If you are unsure about what trends you want to show, talk to me before
starting to code. Further, try to adhere to the following principles in your visualization:
1. Do not use more dimensions (color, shape, size, etc.) than you need. Having circles appear
both larger and darker due to more divisiveness is redundant.
2. Convey only relevant information â€“ think of the message your graphic is meant to present;
for each piece of information, ask yourself if the graphic would work equally well without!
