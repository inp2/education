# Week 12 - Interactive Visualizations

We will introduce interactivity as an important feature for data visualizations. Interactivity is an important feature as it helps bridge gaps of knowledge. A good interactive tool doesn't require any technical knowledge, examples of interactive data visualizations from major publications including the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/29/us/year-in-interactive-storytelling.html#data-visualization). The goal is to provide an intuitive way for anyone to understand the data regardless of technical knowledge.
