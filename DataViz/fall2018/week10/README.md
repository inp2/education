# In Class Exercise: Getting to Know Tableau

Create a Tableau workbook that explores the basics of data visualization by exploring Animal Bites. The final result should be a dashboard.

## Dataset: [Animal Bites](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/animal-bites)

In the United States, animal bites are often reported to law enforcement (such as animal control). The main concern with an animal bite is that the animal may be rabid. This dataset includes information on over 9,000 animal bites which occurred near Louisville, Kentucky from 1985 to 2017 and includes information on whether the animal was quarantined after the bite occurred and whether that animal was rabid.
