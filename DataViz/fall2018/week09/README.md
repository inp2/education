# Week 9 - Knowing R

We will learn about the data visualization advantages of using R

## Homework 8: Knowing R

I want you to use the data you have to investigate the question of who wins Marvel vs. DC. You are allowed to choose, how you determine. Once again if you are unsure about what trends you want to show, talk to me before starting to code. Further, try to adhere to the following principles in your visualization:

* Do not use more dimensions (color, shape, size, etc.) than you need. Having circles appear both larger and darker due to more divisiveness is redundant.
* Convey only relevant information – think of the message your graphic is meant to present; for each piece of information, ask yourself if the graphic would work equally well without!
* Make use of R’s functionalities!

The data can be found in the data folder.
