# Project Proposal/Group Formation
The proposal should include the names of the members of your group and a short (1 to 2 pages) description of the visualization problem you plan to address. You should work in teams of at least two people for this assignment. You may not work in groups larger than 4 people. If you are looking for project partners, please post on slack in the teams section.

The repository is public by default so people can see your work. If you have any restriction such as data privacy, you can make it private. You can also make it private first and make it public once you finish. Please contact us as soon as possible if you can't access the GitHub org.

## Project Requirements
* Must work with more than one dataset
  * If you have one dataset that examines marriages during the 1950s, have another dataset that looks at divorces during the 1950s
* Datasets must be larger than 5GB
* Datasets variables must be both categorical and continuous
                                                                                                      
Your project proposal should answer the following questions/comments:

1. What is your dataset?
* The size of your dataset
* What are your variables?
* Why did you decide to choose that dataset?

2. A visual of your data visualization development
* How will you store your data?
* How will you access your stored data?
* What languages/frameworks will you use?
* Why did you choose this storage mechanisms, and languages/frameworks?

3. Explain your exploratory data analysis process
* What are you trying to highlight from your data?
* What are your overall goals with this visualization?
* Any possible problems/concerns do you have about accomplishing this task
